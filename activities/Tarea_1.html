            <h3>Cartesian Robots</h3>
            <p>
                Cartesian robots (PPP) are industrial manipulators that move along three mutually perpendicular linear axes (X, Y,
                and Z). Each axis uses a prismatic joint, which results in simple kinematics and high positioning accuracy. Their
                workspace has a rectangular or box-like shape, making them easy to program and control. Due to their rigidity and precision,
                Cartesian robots are commonly used in CNC machines, 3D printers, pick-and-place systems, and automated inspection
                tasks.

            <h3>SCARA Robots</h3>
            <p> SCARA robots (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) consist of two rotational joints followed by one prismatic
                joint. This configuration provides compliance in the horizontal plane and rigidity in the vertical direction. SCARA robots
                are well known for their speed, repeatability, and efficiency in assembly operations. They are widely used in
                electronics manufacturing, packaging, and small-part insertion tasks.

            <h3>Cylindrical Robots</h3>
            <p>
                Cylindrical robots (RPP) consist of one rotational joint at the base followed by two prismatic joints. This
                configuration produces a cylindrical-shaped workspace. Cylindrical robots are valued for their straightforward
                mechanical design and ease of control. They are commonly used in assembly, handling, and palletizing applications
                where
                vertical and radial motions are required.

            <h3>Articulated Robots</h3>
            <p>
                Articulated robots (RRR) are composed of three or more rotational joints arranged similarly to a human arm. This
                structure provides a wide range of motion and high flexibility, allowing the robot to reach complex positions and
                orientations. Articulated robots commonly have six degrees of freedom, enabling full control of the end-effector
                pose.
                They are extensively used in welding, painting, material handling, assembly, and collaborative robotics
                applications.

            <h3>Spherical Robots</h3>
            <p>
                Spherical robots (RRP) use two rotational joints and one prismatic joint, creating a spherical or polar workspace.
                The arm can rotate around a base and extend outward radially, allowing access to different depths and heights. These
                robots were widely used in early industrial automation and are still relevant for material handling and machine loading
                tasks.
                Their mechanical structure is relatively simple, but their flexibility is limited compared to articulated robots.

            <h3>Delta Robots</h3>
            <p>
                Delta robots, also known as parallel robots, are composed of multiple arms connected in parallel between a fixed
                base and a moving platform. This design results in very low moving mass, enabling extremely high speed and acceleration.
                Delta robots offer excellent precision and repeatability, making them ideal for high-speed pick-and-place operations
                in the food, pharmaceutical, and electronics industries. However, their workspace and payload capacity are limited.
